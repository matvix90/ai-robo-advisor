# Weekly Issue Summary Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically generates and posts a weekly summary of repository issues to keep maintainers informed and improve backlog visibility.

> **Reference**: Based on the [GitHub samples models-in-actions weekly-issue-summary workflow](https://github.com/github-samples/models-in-actions/tree/main/workflows/weekly-issue-summary)

## Features

- **Automated Scheduling**: Runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Manual Triggering**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions UI
- **Configurable Labels**: Track specific issue categories (bug, help wanted, triage, etc.)
- **Multiple Outputs**: Posts to GitHub Discussions and creates downloadable artifacts
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Shows new/closed issues, label breakdowns, and net changes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The workflow uses these configurable environment variables:

- `LABELS_TO_INCLUDE`: Comma-separated list of labels to track (default: `bug,help wanted,triage,enhancement,question,documentation`)
- `POST_TO_DISCUSSION`: Whether to post summary to GitHub Discussions (default: `true`)
- `DISCUSSION_CATEGORY`: Discussion category for posting (default: `General`)

### Customization

To customize the workflow:

1. **Change Labels**: Edit the `LABELS_TO_INCLUDE` environment variable in the workflow file
2. **Change Schedule**: Modify the cron expression in the `on.schedule` section
3. **Disable Discussions**: Set `POST_TO_DISCUSSION` to `false`
4. **Add Slack Integration**: Add a new step to post to Slack webhook
