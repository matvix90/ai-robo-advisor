# ü§ñ AI Robo Advisor

Welcome to your personal AI-powered investment assistant! This project aims to make professional-grade investment strategies, similar to those used by hedge funds, accessible to everyone through the power of AI.

This is the system workflow:

1. Investment Agent: collects user preferences via questionnaire and produces a structured Strategy.

2. Portfolio Agent: Translates the Strategy into a concrete ETF portfolio.

3. Analyst Agents:
    - Fees Agent: retrievesand analyze TER per holding.
    - Diversification Agent: compares and analyze portfolio vs strategy across asset class, geography, sector.
    - Alignment Agent: evaluates how holdings reflect risk tolerance, time horizon, expected returns embedded in the Strategy.
    - Performance Agent: computes CAGR, Annualized Volatility, Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Alpha, Beta and analyze if portfolio is performant.
    - Analysis Orchestrator: runs the above analyst agents and aggregates their outputs and provides a structured basis for downstream reporting.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run the project on your local machine? Follow these steps.

Note: 
- Portfolios are created with a maximum of 4 ETFs, and the analysis is performed using 2 years of historical data. These limitations are in place to work within the constraints of the free Polygon.io API key. If you have a paid license, you can modify the code to increase these limits.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matvix90/ai-robo-advisor.git
    cd ai-robo-advisor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file for your API keys:**
    ```bash
    # Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5.  **Set up API Keys:**
    ```bash
    # For running LLMs
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

    # For getting financial data to power the robo advisor
    POLYGON_API_KEY=your-polygon-api-key
    ```

    **Important**: 
    - You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) for the robo advisor to work.
    - You must set POLYGON_API_KEY for the robo advisor to work.

## How to Run

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface
You can run the AI Robo Advisor directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.
